Text: A site for a stained glass artist, this site is quite simple yet effective at showcasing work.

Built on a Wordpress backend, the site comes with a nice CMS that allows the client to easily add and update pages as well as manage media and events.

The homepage layout relies on a card system, which makes it automatically responsive. The interior pages and navigation are also responsive and work great on mobile devies.

Also included with the site was original logo design and business card design to solidify the brand.

We went the free route and advertised the site on Reddit (in the stained glass subreddit) and got a pretty solid response and a good amount of traffic coming from it.
