Text: Welcome, to an old-fashioned linen store established over 120 years ago. We are situated along the beautiful Grand River in the quaint downtown of Paris, Ontario. 

As you walk through the classically detailed front door, let the historic features invite you into a bygone era.

As you stroll across the wooden floor you'll be surrounded by our large and unique selection of linens for every room and season. From embroidered cotton nightgowns, to colourful throws that will transform your house into a home, we have what you're looking for. 

Stop by and say hello, we'd love the visit!
